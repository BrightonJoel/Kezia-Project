Not the most politically correct read I've ever had.  The three main characters are drawn from disadvantaged white, gay and Asian communities and the plot reflects the more negative stereotyping of those cultures.  However, there is a certain inevitability about that in any thriller depicting the seamier side of the human psyche in whatever setting and the characters have sufficient depth to move us beyond the stereotypes.  The interweaving and ultimate collision of the three plotlines works well and is convincing enough, and there are some flashes of humour to lighten the way!

4,The Craze,https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/009946148X?tag=whichbooknet-21&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1,Paul Southern,"A fast moving read with the potential to work on your social conscience or heighten your cynical despair about life in inner cities (specifically Manchester).  Not the most politically correct read I've ever had.  The three main characters are drawn from disadvantaged white, gay and Asian communities and the plot reflects the more negative stereotyping of those cultures.  However, there is a certain inevitability about that in any thriller depicting the seamier side of the human psyche in whatever setting and the characters have sufficient depth to move us beyond the stereotypes.  The interweaving and ultimate collision of the three plotlines works well and is convincing enough, and there are some flashes of humour to lighten the way!

Told through compelling anti-heroine narrator, Joan, the sexual trauma of her past accumulates as her rage takes action in the present.

Even more resonant is the heart-breaking emotional depth, including unflinching scenes of child abuse, rape and miscarriage. It left me reeling.",Very Disturbing

10,Basket of Deplorables,https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XRJPFS8?tag=whichbooknet-21&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1,Tom Rachman,"This is a such a clever book. At first glance it's a collection of short stories but characters and plot lines from one story pop up in others. The book mixes observations about truth, communication and new technology into highly entertaining stories. Short stories are sometimes looked upon as too indirect or fragmentend. Not in this book.

On the front cover there is an endorsement which says the book is 'at once heartbreaking and hilarious', there are certainly some funny moments but as the story is about two young girls living with a violent father, I found it quite disturbing.  The comedy moments centre on Marcia (aged 11) and her frantic desire to be a boy as she like girls.  Again though there is too much pathos in her situation to laugh for long and I felt great relief when the sisters escape to their grandmother.  Well worth reading in spite of the Spanish dialect!",Fairly Down to Earth

These individual chapters outline the harmonious religious and cultural tolerances of a number of colourful local villagers,and later their subsequent distrust, sufferings and loss. I did find the interwoven chapters on Mustafa Kemel (founder of modern Turkey) challenging as they read more like a biographical non-fiction account of the Fall of the Ottoman Empire.

This framework works well in drawing you into the story, and the balance between nostalgia and realism is nicely done.  The result is a thoughtful read.

You need to stay awake and on track with this novel. It begins slowly but persevere and don't have any illusion that  the story will 'lighten' as it progresses. It doesn't.  The setting of Lithuania and the ghettos of Poland make for a sad read but you may enjoy this if you have a passing interest in the history of the war and its effect on those who lived through it.
